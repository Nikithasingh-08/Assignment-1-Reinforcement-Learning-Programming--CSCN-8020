# Assignment-1-Reinforcement-Learning-Programming--CSCN-8020

This repository contains solutions to **CSCN8020 - Reinforcement Learning Programming Assignment 1**.

## Problems Covered
1. **Pick-and-Place Robot (MDP Design)**
   - Defined states, actions, rewards, transitions, and discount factor for a robotic arm performing pick-and-place tasks.

2. **2×2 Gridworld (Value Iteration)**
   - Performed two iterations of Value Iteration manually.
   - Verified with Python implementation.
   - Visualized value updates and policy improvement.

3. **5×5 Gridworld (Value Iteration & In-Place Value Iteration)**
   - Implemented standard Value Iteration and In-Place Value Iteration.
   - Compared performance, convergence, and computational complexity.
   - Provided visualizations of optimal values and policies.

4. **5×5 Gridworld (Off-Policy Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling)**
   - Implemented off-policy Monte Carlo evaluation with a random behavior policy.
   - Compared estimated values with Value Iteration results.
   - Visualized Monte Carlo estimated policy vs. Value Iteration policy
